# What is it?
Unamed Command script is a utility script that operates only and only with
roblox chat and nothing else.
# Why Unamed Command Script?
Here at Unamed Command Script, we listen to our community and aim for perfection
Unamed command script has game support meaning you can get auto farm for games like
Bee Swarm Simulator, pet simulator X and more! And our script is SmArT, we automatically enable 
anti afk and enables the autofarm screen. This disables any input from your Keyboard while the
autofarm is on and running. We also provide a huge range of community scripts which can be accessed
through ".SLib" or "/e .SLib"
# What are the features?
Unamed Command Script runs solely with chat.. UI is optional if you want to exploit with OUR script!
Unamed Command Script doesn't send any logs to the main server of the game, meaning if you run ANY command,
it will be undetected. (This is only applicable with /e .command)
We also support /e, meaning if you don't want to show people you are exploiting, you can do /e and whatever command you want!
(with the prefix)
